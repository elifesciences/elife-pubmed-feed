# elife-paw-feed

The goal of this repo is to create a data feed that pipes information into
PubMed. We will use workflows
and patterns developed in [elife bot](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-bot)
and [eLife POA XML](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-poa-xml-generation) to
support this work.
